# CitiBike Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to see the feasibility of opening up a similar business as Citibike in Des Moines. We will present this data finding to a investor for a business proposal te get funding. We used Tableau as it is the most visual friendly coding software and would allow us to make multiple different kind of charts fast and easy.

# Results
## Average Trips
| Average Trip Duration  | Average Trip Duration by Gender | Average Trip Duration by Age

Seen in the Storyboard, The average trip duration seems to be somewhere between 5-6 minutes for people. Once they reach that time their is a quick cut off and goes down. When deciding on strategies to encourage people to ride more we may need to look into some kind of discount for people who use the bike for more then 5 min to get a higher retention rate and more money. 

As seen on the second graph males and females both seem to reach the 5-6 minute mark and then drop off. We can conclude that both men and women use it for similar reasons.

Seen on the third line chart, their is a big number of older people using the bikes for long average trip durations. Could incentivize more older people with a promo or targeted marketing to get more older generations to start using it. Their also seem to be an upward trend  for the younger generation in using the bike for longer periods of time, which may need to be further analyzed.

## Time of Usage

Seen on the heat map, their seems to be a trend of high usage during rush hour during the weekdays, but constant use during 9 AM - 7PM on the weekends. We can try to talk to the government to try and to a joint campaign in reducing car emissions while also promoting our bikes to people for going to work.

The bar chart on the next slide shows that there is almost no usage of our bikes from 1 AM - 4 AM. This would be a perfect time for bike repairs and quality checks on bikes. 

The next heat map shows the difference between men and girls in usage times. They seem to use it for similar reasons, like rush hour on weekdays, and more contant time on weekends, but men seem to have a higher usage overall.

## Gender Usage

Men clearly out number the females by a wide margin for usage across the board for subscribers. They seem to be the ones most inclined to use it, and we could target men when marketing but that could cause issues later. We would prefer to get the number of women using our bikes up, so we should do an analysis of why women are not using our bikes and try to address the concerns. 

# Summary
Overall we believe that Des Moines would be a good place to start our new business, and given the data from Citibike we can assume it would be successful with men and working people. Their seems to be a need/want for the bikes during rush hour especially. 

We would like to do more analysis on the weather and how that would impact the bike usage. We would need to know if we need to cut back on the # of bikes we put out during the winter vs the summer time when people may be more inclined to use bikes as a form of exercise.

Another analysis we should look into is why women are not using the bikes at the same rate as men. It could be for a multitude of reasons and without any data in that it would be hard to do the analysis, but I beleive it would be worth it to grow our market since CitiBike seems to be struggling with getting Female customers.
